# Project 1: Cloud NoSQL Database Exploration

## Description

This project aims to explore the use of cloud-based NoSQL databases, with a focus on comparing MongoDB and Amazon DocumentDB. NoSQL databases are gaining popularity due to their flexibility and scalability, especially in cloud environments. MongoDB and Amazon DocumentDB are two widely used NoSQL databases that offer different features and capabilities. 

The project involves:

- Understanding the key features and use cases of MongoDB and Amazon DocumentDB.
- Analyzing the performance, scalability, and cost aspects of both databases.
- Implementing sample applications or test scenarios to compare the functionalities of MongoDB and Amazon DocumentDB.
- Evaluating the suitability of each database for different types of applications or workloads.
- Providing insights and recommendations based on the comparison results.

## Technologies

- MongoDB
- Amazon DocumentDB
- Python (for scripting and testing)
- Jupyter Notebook (for analysis and visualization)
- Cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) for deployment and testing

## Deliverables

1. **Source Code**: Python scripts or Jupyter Notebooks used for testing and comparison.
2. **Documentation**: Detailed documentation outlining the setup, methodology, and findings of the comparison.
3. **Presentation Slides**: Slides summarizing the project objectives, methodology, results, and conclusions.
